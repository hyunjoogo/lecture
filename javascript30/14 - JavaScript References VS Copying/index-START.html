      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      team[3] = "Joo";
      // now here is the problem!
      console.log(team);
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      // const team3 = [].concat(players);
      // // or use the new ES6 Spread
      // const team4 = [...players];
      // team4[3] = "Joo";
      // const team5 = Array.from(players);
      // // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // // with Objects
      // const person = {
      //   name: "Wes Bos",
      //   age: 80,
      // };

      // // and think we make a copy:

      // // how do we take a copy instead?
      // const people = Object.assign({}, person, { num: 99, age: 12 });
      // // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const cap3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
